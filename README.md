# GitHub and Stack Overflow Mashup - Backend

This is the backend part of the GitHub and Stack Overflow Mashup project in Nestjs. It is responsible for handling API requests, fetching data from GitHub and Stack Overflow, and serving it to the frontend.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get the backend part up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (v6.x or later)

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sbondai/github-and-stack-overflow-mashup-backend.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd github-and-stack-overflow-mashup-backend
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
